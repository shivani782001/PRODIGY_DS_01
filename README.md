# PRODIGY_DS_01
TASK 1 (PRODIGY INFOTECH)

In this task, I have created visualizations to analyze the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using a dataset. Specifically, I focused on creating bar charts and histograms to represent data such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population. This analysis provides a clear and concise view of the data distribution, making it easier to identify patterns and insights.

Key Features
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loaded the dataset and performed necessary preprocessing steps to ensure the data is in a suitable format for analysis and visualization.
2. Bar Chart Visualization: Developed bar charts to display the distribution of various categorical variables. For example, the population of different countries over a range of years, showcasing trends and changes over time.
3. Histogram Visualization: Created histograms to represent the distribution of continuous variables, providing a detailed view of the frequency distribution of data points within specified ranges.
   
Technologies Used
1. Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
2. Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
3. Seaborn: For making statistical graphics and enhancing the visual appeal of the plots.
